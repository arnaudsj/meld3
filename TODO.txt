- Provide parsed tree caching facility.

- Provide pipelining tools.

- Preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" On tags when it's
  provided during xhtml output (or figure out why it makes the XML
  writer go berserk and output every tag with that qualified
  namespace, or just output it by default in XHTML mode only if that
  makes sense).

- Come up with something like "__mod__" which returns the ids present
  in the keys of the operand dictionary that were actually replaced
  (for error detection).

- Come up with a structure diffing API which can tell which meld:id
  elements are present, missing, or moved in one element tree as
  compared to another.  The output of a script that used this might
  be, for example, a good CVS email-at-commit hook to alert developers
  and designers that some change demands attention on the part of the
  developer (or that the designer removed some meld ids
  inappropriately).

- Revisit <![CDATA serialization.  Currently CDATA containers are
  thrown away at parse time, and are thus not present in the output
  stream.  Investigate how different browsers deal with this (esp. wrt
  to escaped cdata in "script" and "style" elements when XHTML
  serialization is used).

- Document the proper usage of <meta content="text/html;
  charset=ISO-8859-1" http-equiv="content-type">.  Maybe output an
  http-equiv content type tag by default matching the serlialization
  mode.

- Make 'repeat' retain tail cdata on repeated nodes so output looks
  nicer.

- Inject xmlns:meld="http://www.plope.com/software/meld3" onto root
  tag when before expat parsing by default (condition with a flag), as
  NVU doesn't retain non-XHTML namespace declarations when it
  saves. :-( The same situation likely exists for other WYSIWYG
  editors.  Sigh.

- Investigate why using the "plope.com" namespace identifier is bad.
